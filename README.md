🧭 Introduction

In today's digital age, having an accessible and well-structured historical website is essential for preserving and sharing cultural heritage. A dedicated website on national heroes like Dr. Jose Rizal serves as a central hub for students, educators, researchers, and the general public to access important historical information, including biographies, key events, literary works, and visual archives.

With the increasing reliance on digital platforms, it is crucial to ensure that historical resources are presented in a simple, responsive, and engaging format to enhance user experience and promote national awareness.

Despite the importance of digital history, many educational and cultural websites still struggle with outdated designs, poor navigation, and lack of responsiveness. Some platforms rely on complex content management systems that require technical expertise to maintain, while others lack structured content, making it difficult to locate accurate historical information efficiently. Poorly designed websites can lead to misinformation, reduced accessibility, and diminished engagement with historical narratives (Dela Cruz & Morales, 2022).

Developing a structured and user-friendly historical website is crucial in addressing these challenges. A well-organized digital archive enhances accessibility, provides reliable historical data, and improves learning experiences for students and researchers. By using a lightweight and efficient framework like W3.CSS, this project ensures a responsive design that works seamlessly across various devices, promoting inclusivity and wider reach (Baltazar et al., 2024).
